# Things to Work on
1. Work on the missing part of the dashboard menu: 
- Accounts
- Transactions
- Customer Support
- Settings

2. Let the **Wallet** be updated and have a default value of 100 NGN.
> When a transaction operation is initiated, the increase or decrease of the balance, should take effect on the balance.
> Write out the logic of each operation, while for accounts, they are just details stored from when the person registered and are shown in a way like a user profile format - **Outstanding UI/UX**.

3. *(optional)* Try working on sending details to the gmail as well or using `import random` to generate random 6 digits numbers *OTP*, which are used for verification. The OTP is sent to the user's mail and the user inputs the digits in a popup input field with a **_"Verify User"_** button.
> Make sure to choose the one with less stress **EASIER**
